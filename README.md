# Minecraft Packet Analyzer Proxy

Description
---
Minecraft Packet Analyzer Proxy is a regular TCP proxy with a packet parser for Minecraft: Java Edition (1.14.4). It
is currently a WIP.

The parser is being made with the information present in [wiki page]("https://wiki.vg/Protocol").

This was built with a similiar structure to the proxy made by LiveOverflow for the game PwnAdventure3. If you want
a detailed explanation of how this works you should see his video.


##### About encryption:
For now, I don't have the sufficient knowledge to implement protocol encryption support, this means the proxy can only
be used in servers in offline mode.

For more information about protocol encryption, check 
[the wiki page]("https://wiki.vg/Protocol_Encryption").
